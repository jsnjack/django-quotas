This Django application adds support for numerical quotas based on
django.contrib.auth users, groups and permissions.

Quotas are configured with QUOTAS setting, which should be
a dictionary where keys are quota parameter name, and values are tuple
of limit values.  Application creates specific permissions based on
this specification.  For exaplne, setting:

    QUOTAS = {
        "user_number" : (1, 5, 20),
        "file_space" : (5, 10),
        }

would result in creating permissions: quotas.quota_user_number_1,
quotas.quota_user_number_5, quotas.quota_user_number_20,
quotas.quota_user_number_unlimited, quota.file_space_5,
quota.file_space_10. quota.file_space_unlimited.

Assigning specific quotas to users means assigning them (or their
groups) one of those permissions.  For convenience,
django.auth.models.User.quotas property is added.  Its attributes
reflect quota values for user, e.g. if user `u' has
`quotas.quota_user_number_5' permission, `u.quotas.user_number' equals
5.  If user has no permission asigned for the quota, attribute value
is `None'.  If user has unlimited quota, attribute value is
`quotas.UNLIMITED' sentinel, which is instance of quotas.Unlimited
class that is greater than any value, and it string representation is
'unlimited'.  If User instance has several quota permissions assigned,
attribute value reflects the highes quota.
