This Django application adds support for numerical quotas based on
django.contrib.auth users, groups and permissions.

Quotas are configured with QUOTAS setting, which should be
a dictionary where keys are quota parameter name, and values are tuple
of limit values.  Application creates specific permissions based on
this specification.  For exaplne, setting:

    QUOTAS = {
        "user_number" : (1, 5, 20),
        "file_space" : (5, 10),
        }

would result in creating permissions: quotas.quota_user_number_1,
quotas.quota_user_number_5, quotas.quota_user_number_20,
quotas.quota_user_number_unlimited, quota.file_space_5,
quota.file_space_10. quota.file_space_unlimited.

Assigning specific quotas to users means assigning them (or their
groups) one of those permissions.  For convenience,
django.auth.models.User.get_quota(name) method is added, which
returns:
 - None if User instance does not have any of quota permissions for
   name assigned,
 - value if User instance has some specific quota permission assigned,
 - and True if User instance has unlimited quota permission assigned.
If User instance has several quota permissions assigned, highes quota
is returned.
